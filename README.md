# Dysco
Dynamic Service Chaining

To compile the kernel module, choose the appropriate driver and run make in the driver directory. The driver directories are under the directory kernel. You can run Dysco with the drivers ixgbe, e1000, and veth. Also, if you want to run a middlebox that uses the kernel stack, you can run Dysco with Linux netfilter (nf).

The directory experiments/evaluation contain the scripts for running the experiments that appear on the paper.

If you are facing any problem while running Dysco, please do not hesitate to contact me at raf@facom.ufms.br.
